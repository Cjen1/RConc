Testing Metrics:
	Throughput - given ratio of read/write how many ops per sec (randomised)
	Availability - 
		latency before read/write
		max/min latency (draw graphs)

Tests
	Unreliable hosts 	(kill servers randomly)
	Unreliable links 	(stop links between servers randomly)
	Conflicting ops 	(send from multiple clients to multiple servers in the worst case writes/reads which are on the same key)
	Latency of links 	(artifically increase latency between clusters)
	Split DataCentre	(have low latency between one subset and high latency between others)
	Slow machines (?) where read/writes are very expensive to do
	Slow node			(One node is under contnetion internally [busy wait programs])
	Unreliable Storage	(random writes to storage medium)

Notes
	Try not to DoS CL
	Ensure that all datasets exist are kept off test servers
	Ensure that all runs are performed on clean hardware (see reload from image)
	May want to checksum the snapshots to ensure that they are correctly being replicated
