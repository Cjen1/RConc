ESTABLISHING A COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT CONSENSUS SYSTEMS
-- General Method

	0.1 - Problem Statement.
		There are various systems for achieving consensus, our goal is to establish a comparison
		between the most important ones based off testing under consistent, reproducible, condi-
		tions. 
		The systems being compared are: (subject to expansion)
		- Apache Zookeeper
		- etcd
	
	1.1 - Environment Setup.
		All consensus systems are tested on identical hardware, on 3/5 servers running Ubuntu 
		16.0.4. The different systems are deployed in Docker containers, each server respective-
		ly running one, and clients for tests are run from an additional machine.
	
	2.1 - Testing Procedure
		For each of the systems, a client in an appropriate language is written, and scripts to
		initially start the systems, as well as restart them in the case of a failure, as well
		as making the Docker container stop (to emulate failure). Then the test suite runs iden-
		tical tests on all of the different systems usiing these utilities, to ensure fair test-
		ing.
		The test suite is entirely customizable in terms of the kinds of operations to be car-
		ried out, the stability of the servers, and the number of clients making requests.
